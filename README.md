## Installation

Use r2modman by ebkr from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest).

While the mod shouldn't touch any save data it is recommended to backup your save from `%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Hades II\Profile*.sav` in case there are unforseen issues.
